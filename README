--REQUIREMENTS--

To compile Smac2 one needs : 
    * MPI - Message Passing Interface
    * cfitsio - FITS I/O library in c
    * GSL - GNU Scientic Library
    * optionally HDF5 >1.8 - The Hierachical Data Format 

Use the SYSTYPE fields to adapt the compilations paths in Makefile.

Smac2 uses the GADGET style Config file for Compiletimesettings.
This is parsed via sed in the Makefile into src/print_settings.c
to provide similar functionality without the need for Perl.

I recommend to use O_FITS_COMPRESSED, which will use Rice compression 
on the image and reduce the file size by a factor of 8 ! The file
will remain readable with IDL and DS9, only the extension are shifted by
1, i.e. the image is found with readfits(fname, ext=1) in IDL.

Smac2 now contains an OpenMP parallel tree and neighbour finding, which 
gives the same results as Gadget3.

--HOW TO ADD AN EFFECT--

1) make your effect function in src/effects/EFFECTNAME.c
2) put the prototype in src/effects/effect.h
3) add another case in src/effects/effect.c 
4) add your effect function file as .o in Makefile
5) add a desciption at the end of Makefile


--HOW TO ADD A BLOCK--
1) in src/input/gadget.h add your block IO type
    in the enum
2) in src/input/gadget.c add your in set_block_prop()
3) in the same file add it in empty_comm_buffer()

--TODO--

* Improve local sort on pixel number for cache hits
* Do Healpix projection
* Read Peano key
* Add full DM annihilation model instead of rho^2
* rewrite parser 
* Mecal X-ray description 
* peano curve
* weighted indicator
